# GPU_Parrelilisation

<p align="center">
Using the base of intel one api to code up a oascals trtiangle calculation the base value of a modifiable integer, this program allows for quick and almost instintanous calculation using the high thread and core count of modern Graphics Proccessing Units (GPU's)

<p align="center">
The modifiable files can be found in the masters branch, this can aslo be directly downloaded into VS Studio 2022, once the intel one api has also bee downloaded and configured onto the system to allow for the DPC++ code base to compile using (only intels) GPU's to do their multi-threading work and tasks.
